# Axiom Data Science - Mini Challenges - Python Data Debugging

Welcome and thank you for continuing the Axiom interview process!

We use this take-home coding challenge to supplement the interview process; it allows us to understand your abilities and experiences with different development tools and programming concepts without asking generic high level questions during a video interview. We have found it much more beneficial to let you showcase your abilities here, in actual code, as you would do if you were working here at Axiom.

## What should you do

This project is a self-contained python file (`run.py`) that does three things:

* Loads data from a local data file (`data.csv`)
* Computes the average for each data column
* Returns the averages in a Python dictionary

**Solve the following 3 tasks** by editing the `run.py` file. Solve these in order and commit each of them as a separate git commit to the same branch.

1. Get this program running as intended (it is broken). It will exit correctly when it is working. In this commit, use only the Python standard library (no external dependencies).
2. Optimize the runtime of this program (make it faster). In this commit, you may add and use additional dependencies outside of the Python standard library. We are more interested in your thought process and how you approach this task rather than how fast you can make it.
3. Enhance this program. It is up to you what you want to improve.

To get started, try running the `run.py` file:

```shell
python run.py
```

This is intended to take less than 2 hours to complete, please don't spend more time than that. If you struggle or find that you have exceeded two hours please submit what you have completed and we will talk through it as is.

## What we are looking for

This challenge is designed gauge your experience level with `git` and `python`, but that is not all we are looking for. Come to the technical interview ready to talk about how you approached the tasks and what your thought process was for each. We are more interested in your problem solving methodology and how you approach debugging code you have never seen before. We are less interested in how much faster you made the program.

If anything is confusing or ambiguous about this project, it wasn't meant to be. We are not trying to trick you, fool you, or waste your time. Please let us know if this is the case and we can talk through it and clarify any questions you may have.

## Submitting your work

Please submit your work via a GitHub project. You can upload the code to Github directly, fork this repository and push up to that fork, create your own new repository with your code and push to that, or really anything that works for you.

Our only requests are that you:

1. Submit your work in the form of a link to a GitHub repository that contains your solutions,
2. Make sure that your GitHub repository is public or you have invited users `kwilcox` and `srstsavage` with read permissions,
3. Do not open a pull request against the GitHub repository you were sent.
